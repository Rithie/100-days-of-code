# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 4, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on the basic markup for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS and responsiveness stuff.

### Day 1: January 5, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, studied the javascript side of the application.

**Thoughts**: I had some difficulties :grimacing: on working with pure JS, but that's the way. I'll get the pace as time goes by...let's see =)

### Day 2: June 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many examples across the internet and I figured something :tada:. The app still has a lot of bugs and flaws
but, I think it's getting its shape.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding using pure JS, and it's a great feeling when I finally understand something about it. 
I know, I'm not doing the elegant way yet... but I'll get there. Hold on tight!!!! :ghost:
